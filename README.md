# Tableau-Dashboard-for-SuperStore
We have created a Data Visualization for SuperStore using Tableau 

# Tableau 
Tableau is Data Visualization tool which can help anyone see and understand their data. Connect to almost any database, drag and drop to create visualizations, and share with a click.

Here we can connect to Tableau Desktop and Tableau public. Here is the difference betweeen both:

# Tableau Desktop: 
We can connect to multiple data sources here and It costs to approx 80,000/year.

# Tableau Public:
We can connect to limited Data sources, it costs nothing we can download itself and It is 90% same to Tableau Desktop.
